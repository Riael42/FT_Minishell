# 42's Minishell

Project done in cooperation with a great peer which can be found at https://github.com/LoneOne123

It's a mini shell, replicating the pipe execution order of bash (cat | cat | ls)
It can execute commands with binaries foudn in the PATH variable or by giving it a relative/absolute path.
Has a working history and the echo/cd/pwd/export/unset/env/exit built in commands, 
although not all of their features were implemented due to being outside of the scope of the project.
Working file redirection and heredoc and environment variable expansion.
